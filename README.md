# project_plasticity_GK

this is a project presented at LASCON VI, studying the effects of plasticity in neuronal gain control, was well as its relation with dendritic tree properties. 
In order to do that, we imported a morphological reconstruction of a pyramidal cell from neuromorpho.org.
Interestingly, this cell belonged to a guy with my age, 23 years old.
Then, we stimulated three diferent parts of the dendritic tree with different delay regimes. 

We could see some differences in the output of our model, most due to poisson-noise properties and dendritic tree low-pass filtering.
